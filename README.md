## Installation

To integrate the plugin in your Flutter App, you need
to add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pusher_channels_flutter: '^1.0.1'
```

### iOS specific installation

The Pusher Channels Flutter plugin adds the
pusher-websocket-swift cocoapod to your project.
You probably need to run a

```bash
$ pod install
```

in the ios directory.

### Android specific installation

Gradle should automatically include the
pusher-websocket-java dependency.

### Web specific installation

For web this plugin uses pusher-js, you can load it from the Pusher CDN, or add it locally. You
probably want to include it in the head of your
index.html page:

```html
<head>
  <script
    charset="utf-8"
    src="https://js.pusher.com/8.3.0/pusher.min.js"
  ></script>
  ...
</head>
```

## Initialization

The PusherChannelFlutter class is a singleton, that
can be instantiated with `getInstance()`. Then you need to initialize the client with a number of configuration options, here is a quick example with a number of callbacks options:

```dart
PusherChannelsFlutter pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter.getInstance();
try {
  await pusher.init(
    apiKey: API_KEY,
    cluster: API_CLUSTER,
    onConnectionStateChange: onConnectionStateChange,
    onError: onError,
    onSubscriptionSucceeded: onSubscriptionSucceeded,
    onEvent: onEvent,
    onSubscriptionError: onSubscriptionError,
    onDecryptionFailure: onDecryptionFailure,
    onMemberAdded: onMemberAdded,
    onMemberRemoved: onMemberRemoved,
    // authEndpoint: "<Your Authendpoint>",
    // onAuthorizer: onAuthorizer
  );
  await pusher.subscribe(channelName: 'presence-chatbox');
  await pusher.connect();
} catch (e) {
  print("ERROR: $e");
}
```

After calling `init(...)` you can connect to the Pusher servers.
You can subscribe to channels before calling `connect()`

## Configuration

There are a number of configuration parameters which can be set for the Pusher client. The following table
describes for which platform the parameter is available:

| parameter                | Android | iOS | Web |
| ------------------------ | ------- | --- | --- |
| activityTimeout          | ✅      | ✅  | ✅  |
| apiKey                   | ✅      | ✅  | ✅  |
| authParam                | ⬜️      | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| authEndpoint             | ✅      | ✅  | ✅  |
| authTransport            | ⬜️      | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| cluster                  | ✅      | ✅  | ✅  |
| disabledTransports       | ⬜️     | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| enabledTransports        | ⬜️     | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| enableStats              | ⬜️     | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| ignoreNullOrigin         | ⬜️     | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| logToConsole             | ⬜️     | ⬜️ | ✅  |
| maxReconnectGapInSeconds | ✅      | ✅  | ⬜️ |
| maxReconnectionAttempts  | ✅      | ✅  | ⬜️ |
| pongTimeout              | ✅      | ✅  | ✅  |
| proxy                    | ✅      | ⬜️ | ⬜️ |
| useTLS                   | ✅      | ✅  | ⬜️ |

#### `activityTimeout (double)`

After this time (in seconds) without any messages received from the server, a ping message will be sent to check if the connection is still working; the default value is supplied by the server, low values will result in unnecessary traffic.

#### `apiKey (String)`

You can get your `API_KEY` and `API_CLUSTER` from the [Pusher Channels dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/).

#### `authParams (Map)`

Allows passing additional data to authorizers. Supports query string params and headers (AJAX only). For example, following will pass `foo=bar` via the query string and `baz: boo` via headers:

```dart
final pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter.getInstance()
await pusher.init(
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  cluster: API_CLUSTER,
  authParams: {
    'params': { 'foo': 'bar' },
    'headers': { 'baz': 'boo' }
  }
});
```

Additional parameters to be sent when the channel authentication endpoint is called. When using [ajax authentication](https://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users#ajax_authentication) the parameters are passed as additional `POST` parameters. When using [jsonp authentication](http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users#jsonp_authentication) the parameters are passed as `GET` parameters. This can be useful with web application frameworks that guard against [CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).

CSRF

If you require a CSRF header for incoming requests to the private channel authentication endpoint on your server, you should add a CSRF token to the `auth` hash under `headers`. This is applicable to frameworks which apply CSRF protection by default.

```dart
final pusher = await pusher.init(
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  cluster: API_CLUSTER,
  authParams: {
    'params': { 'foo': 'bar' },
    'headers': { 'X-CSRF-Token': 'SOME_CSRF_TOKEN' }
  }
);
```

#### `authEndpoint (String)`

The authEndpoint provides a URL that the
Pusher client will call to authorize users
for a presence channel. On how to implement
an authorization service please check here:

https://pusher.com/docs/channels/server_api/authenticating-users/

#### `cluster (String)`

Specifies the cluster that pusher-js should connect to. [If you'd like to see a full list of our clusters, click here](https://pusher.com/docs/clusters). If you do not specify a cluster, `mt1` will be used by default.

#### `useTLS (bool)`

Whether or not you'd like to use TLS encrypted transport or not, default is `true`

## Event Callback parameters

The following functions are callbacks that can be passed to the `init()` method. All are optional.

#### `onEvent`

```dart
void onEvent(PusherEvent event) {
  print("onEvent: $event");
}
```

Called when a event is received by the client.
The global event handler will trigger on events from any channel.

#### `onSubscriptionSucceeded`

```dart
void onSubscriptionSucceeded(String channelName, dynamic data) {
  print("onSubscriptionSucceeded: $channelName data: $data");
}
```

use this if you want to be informed of when a channel has successfully been subscribed to, which is useful if you want to perform actions that are only relevant after a subscription has succeeded. For example querying the members for presence channel.

#### `onSubscriptionError`

```dart
void onSubscriptionError(String message, dynamic e) {
  print("onSubscriptionError: $message Exception: $e");
}
```

use this if you want to be informed of a failed subscription attempt, which you could use, for example, to then attempt another subscription or make a call to a service you use to track errors.

#### `onDecryptionFailure`

```dart
void onDecryptionFailure(String event, String reason) {
  print("onDecryptionFailure: $event reason: $reason");
}
```

only used with private encrypted channels - use this if you want to be notified if any messages fail to decrypt.

#### `onMemberAdded`

```dart
void onMemberAdded(String channelName, PusherMember member) {
  print("onMemberAdded: $channelName member: $member");
}
```

Called when a member is added to the presence channel.

#### `onMemberRemoved`

```dart
void onMemberRemoved(String channelName, PusherMember member) {
  print("onMemberRemoved: $channelName member: $member");
}
```

Called when a member is removed to the presence channel.

#### `onAuthorizer`

When passing the `onAuthorizer()` callback to the `init()` method, this callback is called to request auth information. For more information on how
to generate the correct information, please look here:
https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library_auth_reference/auth-signatures/

```dart
dynamic onAuthorizer(String channelName, String socketId, dynamic options) async {
  return {
    "auth": "foo:bar",
    "channel_data": '{"user_id": 1}',
    "shared_secret": "foobar"
  };
}
```

#### `onConnectionStateChange`

```dart
void onConnectionStateChange(dynamic currentState, dynamic previousState) {
  print("Connection: $currentState");
}
```

use this if you want to use connection state changes to perform different actions / UI updates
The different states that the connection can be in are:

- `CONNECTING` - the connection is about to attempt to be made
- `CONNECTED` - the connection has been successfully made
- `DISCONNECTING` - the connection has been instructed to disconnect and it is just about to do so
- `DISCONNECTED` - the connection has disconnected and no attempt will be made to reconnect automatically
- `RECONNECTING` - an attempt is going to be made to try and re-establish the connection

#### `onError`

```dart
void onError(String message, int? code, dynamic e) {
  print("onError: $message code: $code exception: $e");
}
```

use this if you want to be informed of errors received from Pusher Channels e.g. `Application is over connection quota`. You can find some of the possible errors listed [here](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library_auth_reference/pusher-websockets-protocol#error-codes).

## Connection handling

### Connecting

To connect to the Pusher network, just call the `connect()` method.

```dart
await pusher.connect();
```

### Disconnecting

To disconnect to the Pusher network, just call the `disconnect()` method.

```dart
await pusher.disconnect();
```

### Reconnection

There are three main ways in which a disconnection can occur:

- The client explicitly calls disconnect and a close frame is sent over the websocket connection
- The client experiences some form of network degradation which leads to a heartbeat (ping/pong) message being missed and thus the client disconnects
- The Pusher server closes the websocket connection; typically this will only occur during a restart of the Pusher socket servers and an almost immediate reconnection should occur

In the case of the first type of disconnection the library will (as you'd hope) not attempt a reconnection.

## Subscribing

### Public channels

The default method for subscribing to a channel involves invoking the `subscribe` method of your client object:

```dart
final myChannel = await pusher.subscribe(channelName: "my-channel");
```

### Private channels

Private channels are created in exactly the same way as public channels, except that they reside in the 'private-' namespace. This means prefixing the channel name:

```dart
final myPrivateChannel = await pusher.subscribe(channelName: "private-my-channel")
```

Subscribing to private channels involves the client being authenticated. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for the authenticated channel example for more information.

### Private encrypted channels

Similar to Private channels, you can also subscribe to a [private encrypted channel](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/encrypted-channels). This library now fully supports end-to-end encryption. This means that only you and your connected clients will be able to read your messages. Pusher cannot decrypt them.

Like with private channels, you must provide an authentication endpoint. That endpoint must be using a [server client that supports end-to-end encryption](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/encrypted-channels#server). There is a [demonstration endpoint to look at using nodejs](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-channels-auth-example#using-e2e-encryption).

The shared secret used to decrypt events is loaded from the same auth endpoint request that is used to authorize your subscription. There is also a mechanism for reloading the shared secret if your encryption master key changes. If an event is encountered that cannot be decrypted, a request is made to your auth endpoint to attempt to load the new shared secret. If that request fails or if the returned secret still cannot decrypt the event then that event will be skipped, the `onDecryptionFailure` callback function will be called, and the next received event will be processed.

#### Limitations

- Client events are not supported on encrypted channels

```dart
final privateEncryptedChannel = await pusher.subscribe(channelName: "private-encrypted-my-channel")
```

There is also an optional callback in the connection delegate when you can listen for
any failed decryption events:

```dart
optional func void onDecryptionFailure(String event, String reason)
```

### Presence channels

Presence channels are channels whose names are prefixed by `presence-`.

The resulting channel object has a member: `members` that contains the active members of the channel.

```dart
final myPresenceChannel = await pusher.subscribe(channelName: "presence-my-channel")
```

You can also provide functions that will be called when members are either added to or removed from the channel. These are available as parameters to `init()` globally, or to `subscribe()` per channel.

```dart
void onMemberAdded(String channelName, PusherMember member) {
  print("onMemberAdded: $channelName user: $member");
}
```

```dart
void onMemberRemoved(String channelName, PusherMember member) {
  print("onMemberRemoved: $channelName user: $member");
}
```

**Note**: The `members` property of `PusherChannel` objects will only be set once subscription to the channel has succeeded.

The easiest way to find out when a channel has been successfully subscribed to is to bind to the callback named `onSubscriptionSucceeded` on the channel you're interested in. It would look something like this:

```dart
final pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter.getInstance();
final channels = {};
await pusher.init(
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  cluster: API_CLUSTER,
  authEndPoint: "https://your-server.com/pusher/auth"
);
final myChannel = await pusher.subscribe(
  channelName:'presence-my-channel',
  onSubscriptionSucceeded: (channelName, data) {
    print("Subscribed to $channelName");
    print("I can now access me: ${myChannel.me}")
    print("And here are the channel members: ${myChannel.members}")
  },
  onMemberAdded: (member) {
    print("Member added: $member");
  },
  onMemberRemoved: (member) {
    print("Member removed: $member");
  },
  onEvent: (event) {
    print("Event received: $event");
  },
);
```

Note that both private and presence channels require the user to be authenticated in order to subscribe to the channel. This authentication can either happen inside the library, if you configured your Pusher object with your app's secret, or an authentication request is made to an authentication endpoint that you provide, again when initializing your Pusher object.

We recommend that you use an authentication endpoint over including your app's secret in your app in the vast majority of use cases. If you are completely certain that there's no risk to you including your app's secret in your app, for example if your app is just for internal use at your company, then it can make things easier than setting up an authentication endpoint.

### Unsubscribing

To unsubscribe from a channel, call the `unsubscribe()` method:

```dart
await pusher.unsubscribe("my-channel");
```

## Binding to events

Events can be bound to at 2 levels; globally and per channel. There is an example of this below.

### Per-channel events

These are bound to a specific channel, and mean that you can reuse event names in different parts of your client application.

```dart
final pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter.getInstance();
await pusher.init(
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  cluster: API_CLUSTER
);
final myChannel = await pusher.subscribe(
  channelName: "my-channel",
  onEvent: (event) {
    print("Got channel event: $event");
  }
);
await pusher.connect();
```

### Global events

You can attach behavior to these events regardless of the channel the event is broadcast to.

```dart
final pusher = PusherChannelsFlutter.getInstance();
await pusher.init(
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  cluster: API_CLUSTER,
  onEvent: (event) {
    print("Got event: $event");
  }
);
final myChannel = await pusher.subscribe(
  channelName: "my-channel"
);
```

### PusherEvent

The callbacks you bind receive a `PusherEvent`:

```dart
class PusherEvent {
  String channelName; // Name of the channel.
  String eventName; // Name of the event.
  dynamic data; // Data, usually JSON string. See [parsing event data](#parsing-event-data).
  String? userId; // UserId of the sending event, only for client events on presence channels.
}
```

#### Parsing event data

The `data` property of [`PusherEvent`](#pusherevent) contains the string representation of the data that you passed when you triggered the event. If you passed an object then that object will have been serialized to JSON. You can parse that JSON as appropriate.

### Receiving errors

Errors received from Pusher Channels can be accessed via the `onError` callback.

```dart
void onError(String message, int? code, dynamic e) {
  print("onError: $message code: $code exception: $e");
}
```

## Triggering events

Once a [private](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/private-channels) or [presence](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/presence-channels) subscription has been authorized (see [authenticating users](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/server_api/authenticating-users)) and the subscription has succeeded, it is possible to trigger events on those channels. You can do this per channel, or
on the global `PusherChannelsFlutter` instance.

```dart
await myChannel.trigger(eventName: "client-my-event", data: ["myName": "Bob"]);
```

Or on the global pusher instance:

```dart
await pusher.trigger(channelName: "my-channel", eventName: "client-my-event", data: ["myName": "Bob"]);
```

Events triggered by clients are called [client events](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/events#triggering-client-events). Because they are being triggered from a client which may not be trusted there are a number of enforced rules when using them. Some of these rules include:

- Event names must have a `client-` prefix
- Rate limits
- You can only trigger an event when the subscription has succeeded

For full details see the [client events documentation](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/events#triggering-client-events).

## Get a channel by name

To get the `PusherChannel` instance from the `Pusher` instance you can use the `getChannel(<channelName>)` method:

```dart
final channel = pusher.getChannel("presence-channel");
```

## Socket information

To get information from the current socket call the `getSocketId()` method:

```dart
final socketId = await pusher.getSocketId();
```
